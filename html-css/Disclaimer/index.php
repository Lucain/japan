You agree to check for notices.  In addition, or in lieu thereof, Sparkrelief may give notice by sending e-mail to any e-mail address You provide to Sparkrelief.

					<p>18.GENERAL.</p>
					<p>18.1Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of Your rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned, transferred, or delegated by You in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written approval of Sparkrelief.  Any assignment, transfer or delegation in derogation of the foregoing shall be null and void.  Sparkrelief may assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement, any obligation or right hereunder, or any portion hereof at any time without notice to You.</p>
					<p>18.2Force Majeure.  Any failure of Sparkrelief to perform or delay in the performance of Sparkrelief’s obligations under this Agreement due to any cause or event not reasonably within Sparkrelief’s control, including but not limited to casualty, labor disputes, failure of equipment or carriers or utilities, compliance with governmental authority or Act of God, shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, and Sparkrelief’s performance shall be excused during such period of delay.</p>
					<p>18.3Governing Language and Law.  The governing language of this Agreement is English, which language will be controlling in all respects as to this Agreement and all notices, communications or transactions under this Agreement. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties arising hereunder shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado exclusively, without regard to the choice of law provision thereof and to the greatest extent possible as such laws apply to contracts between Colorado residents performed entirely within Colorado.  The parties specifically exclude from application to the Agreement the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.  You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts sitting in Denver, Colorado (U.S.A.) for the adjudication of all disputes, controversies, or claims arising under or relating to this Agreement or otherwise between the parties.</p>
					<p>18.4Severability. If any part of this Agreement is for any reason found to be unenforceable, all other parts nevertheless remain enforceable as long as a party's rights under this Agreement are not materially affected.  In lieu of the unenforceable provision, the parties will substitute or add as part of this Agreement an enforceable provision that will be as similar as possible in economic and business objectives as was intended by the unenforceable provision.</p>
					<p>18.5Waiver.  All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing.  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
