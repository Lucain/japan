					<h2>Sparkrelief Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>Sparkrelief, Inc., a Colorado Nonprofit corporation ("Sparkrelief," “Us,” or “We”) is the operator of the http://quakehousing.com website (the “Site”).  This privacy policy (this “Policy”) discloses Sparkrelief’s information privacy practices for the Site and is intended to inform users and other visitors to the Site of the data collection and use practices of the Site.</p>
					<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should contact Sparkrelief by e-mail at team@Sparkrelief.org.</p>
					
					<h3>Amendments.</h3>
					<p>Amendments to this Policy will be posted on the Site and will be effective when posted.  Your continued use of the Site following the posting of any amendment will constitute your acceptance of that amendment, except if your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner.  See the Notification of Changes section below for further information.</p>
					
					<h3>Registered Users.</h3>
					<p>Registration is not mandatory to access the public areas of the Site.  Registration is, however, required for access to certain areas of the Site and the services provided through those areas of the Site.  The areas of the Site requiring registration are noted on the Site.</p>
					<p>Users registering to receive an account on the Site will be provided with (or will select) a username and password for purposes of accessing their account and the portions of the Site available to account holders.  When accessing the portions of the Site available to account holders, users may be required to provide their username and password.</p>
					<p>Sparkrelief is not responsible for any loss or misuse of your username and password. <span class="caps">Always remember that in order to protect your privacy you should not share your username or password with others.</span></p>
					
					<h3>Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
					<p>Personally identifiable information includes information by which you may be personally identified, either directly or in combination with other information.  We only collect and share personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site as described in this Policy.  Except as noted in this Policy, personally identifiable information collected on the Site is NOT shared with third parties without your consent.</p>
					<p>We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site.  We may also collect personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site, such as responses, registrations, surveys, reviews, comments, emails, postings, messages or other submissions and communications sent by you to Sparkrelief or the Site.  The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Domain name and IP address;</li>
					<li>E-mail address;</li>
					<li>Contact information (including, name, address, zip code, country, and phone number);</li>
					<li>Gender;</li>
					<li>Mobile phone number, mobile carrier's name, and the date, time and content of mobile communications with the Site;</li>
					<li>GPS or other location-based or geo-positioning information;</li>
					<li>User-specific and aggregate information on areas of the Site accessed;</li>
					<li>Username and password information for the Site; and</li>
					<li>Other information volunteered by You, such as information provided through postings, responses, registrations, reviews, comments, emails, messages or other submissions and communications sent by you to Sparkrelief or the Site.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><span class="caps">You should not provide SPARKRELIEF with any personally identifiable information (or submit or post any personally identifiable information to the site) unless you would like that information to be used by SPARKRELIEF in accordance with this Policy.  Likewise, you should not submit or post any personally identifiable information to the Site unless you want that information to be accessible by other users of the Site, as information posted on a Site may be made available to other users of that Site.</span></p>
					<p>The personally identifiable information that Sparkrelief collects from users of the Site (both registered and unregistered) may be used for a variety of purposes, for example, to:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>provide the services and products offered through the Site to users of the Site;</li>
					<li>customize advertising and other content displayed on the Site and/or the layout of the Site for each individual user of the Site;</li>
					<li>notify users of the Site about updates to and activities on the Site and about goods and services that we feel may be of interest to you;</li>
					<li>improve the content of the Site, to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site;</li>
					<li>contact users of the Site for marketing purposes; or</li>
					<li>contact users of the Site for information verification purposes.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Site with third party companies so that they may offer products and services to users of our Site that we believe will be of interest to those users.  We may also share certain personally identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on the Site and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.  In addition, third party advertisers may receive certain personally identifiable information about you if you click on advertisements displayed on the Site (and clicking on any advertisement displayed on the Site will be considered your consent to “opt in” for this transfer).</p>
					
					<h3>Disclosure as Required by Law.</h3>
					<p>Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of the Site when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect Sparkrelief’s rights under applicable law, including, without limitation, Sparkrelief’s intellectual property rights.  In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure to all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.</p>
					
					<h3>Enhancement of Personal Information.</h3>
					<p>We may combine and enhance our user database information with third party data and information to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers in which we think our users would be interested.  Certain summary demographics are also used in our research product offerings.  Individual personally identifiable information is never used in our research product offering and is never tied back to an individual user or resold for any purposes.</p>
					
					<h3>Service Announcements.</h3>
					<p>On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements.  For instance, if the Site or any of the services offered through the Site is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.  These communications are not promotional in nature.</p>
					
					<h3>Special Offers and Updates.</h3>
					<p>We may send new registrants of the Site a welcoming email to verify password and username.  Established members may occasionally also receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.  Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.</p>
					
					<h3>Your California Privacy Rights.</h3>
					<p>California law provides that California residents have a right to request that businesses tell them how their personally identifiable information has been shared with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  However, there is an exception to this requirement for businesses that have adopted and disclosed, in their privacy policy, a policy of not disclosing a person’s personally identifiable information to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes if that person has exercised an option to opt-out of the disclosure of their personally identifiable information to third parties for such purposes.</p>
					<p>Sparkrelief has adopted a policy of allowing you to opt-out of the disclosure of your personally identifiable information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and thus falls within this exception.  Instructions for opting out can be found in the section below entitled “Choice and Opt-Out.”</p>
					
					<h3>Choice and Opt-out.</h3>
					<p>We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and mailings.</p>
					<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes.  If you are a user of the Site and you no longer wish to receive email, mail, or telephone calls from us or have your email address or postal address shared with third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email, mail or telephone calls from us or having your email address or postal address shared with third parties.</p>
					<p>In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.</p>
					<p>All opt-out requests can be made by emailing team@sparkrelief.org.</p>
					
					<h3>Children.</h3>
					<p>The Site is not directed to children under 13 years of age.  Sparkrelief does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age.  If Sparkrelief discovers it obtained personal information from children under 13 years of age it will delete that content.</p>
					
					<h3>Customer Service.</h3>
					<p>We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and with regard to issues relating to their account, we reply via email, in accordance with the users' wishes.  You may not opt-out of these communications if you would like to use the Services provided through the Site.</p>
					
					<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</h3>
					<p>Where possible, our server automatically recognizes each visitor’s Internet Protocol addresses.  We also collect information about how visitors use the Site (for example what pages are viewed and products and services are purchased).  This information allows us to improve the content of the Site and facilitate market research.  Sometimes, we utilize the services of a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in anonymous and non-personally identifiable form.  Other than improving the Site and the experience of visitors to the Site, we make no other use of this information.</p>
					
					<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons.</h3>
					<p>"Cookies" are commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site.  We may use cookies for various purposes, for example to save user preferences, customize content of the Site for individual users, to ensure that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, to record session information, to save certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site, and in order to facilitate and enhance interaction with the Site.  Sparkrelief does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to Sparkrelief or the Site.</p>
					<p>A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information; however, we may link the information obtained through cookies to other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful experience to you on our Site.</p>
					<p>We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site.  The advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies when it displays an advertisement on the Site.  We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertisement serving company.  We may also use a third party provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and such third party provider may use cookies or web beacons to collect such information.</p>
					<p>Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.</p>
					
					<h3>Access, Review, Update.</h3>
					<p>The users of the Site should email team@sparkelief.org to review, delete/deactivate and update the personal information that was previously provided to us.</p>
					
					<h3>Other Web Sites; Links.</h3>
					<p>Certain of the web sites of Sparkrelief’s affiliates, promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party web sites may be accessible through the Site.  These third party web sites have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.  SPARKRELIEF is not responsible for any actions or privacy policies of such third parties.  You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through linked web sites.</p>
					
					<h3>Consent to the Use of Third Party Providers.</h3>
					<p>In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, Sparkrelief may also contract with other third parties to provide various services to Sparkrelief relating to the Site on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself.  For example, Sparkrelief may contract with a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion of the Site for Sparkrelief.  Sparkrelief may also contract with third party mobile providers to enable the mobile user services provided through the Site.  By visiting the Site, all visitors consent to Sparkrelief providing both personal and non-personal information received from those visitors to these third party providers for the purpose of enabling the third party provider to provide these outsourced services to Sparkrelief.  In addition, all visitors consent to the collection, maintenance, and processing of their personal and non-personal information by Sparkrelief and these third party providers.</p>
					
					<h3>Notification of Changes.</h3>
					<p>If we decide to change this Policy, we will either notify users by way of an e-mail or post material changes on the Site so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and if we disclose it.  Unless we seek and receive your consent, we will use information in accordance with the Policy under which the information was last collected.  Users may prevent their information from being used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by emailing team@sparkrleif.org.</p>
					
					<h3>Security.</h3>
					<p>We will use reasonable security measures on the Site to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal information.  For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted access to that personally identifiable information.  Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Furthermore, when Sparkrelief transfers and receives certain types of sensitive information such as financial or health information, it redirects visitors to a secure server.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p>
					
					<h3>Contact Information.</h3>
					<p>All inquiries concerning this Policy and the Site in general may be sent to team@Sparkrelief.org.</p>
					
					<h3>Transfer of Information.</h3>
					<p>If Sparkrelief elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site to a third party, whether or not in the context of an acquisition of Sparkrelief or a merger of Sparkrelief with a third party, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information by Sparkrelief to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the terms of this Policy.</p>
